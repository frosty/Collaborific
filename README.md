Collaborific!
=============

Collaborific (now hosted via [http://heroku.com](http://heroku.com) at [http://www.collaborific.com](http://www.collaborific.com)) is a collaborative fiction writing network where you and your friends can write stories together!


Outline
=======

* The leader starts a new story and gives it a title and a brief synopsis.
* Each story is made up of chunks called Fics.
* The leader decides how long each Fic should be in words and whether or not the full word count should be enforced.
* She then invites some friends to collaborate with her on the story.
* Each collaborator writes a Fic, in order, starting with the leader.
* The order is determined on a first-come, first-serve basis i.e. the order collaborators accept their invitations.
* Users can request to collaborate on a story by asking the leader and permission is granted or denied at their discretion.
* Users can also subscribe to a story feed and enjoy the story as it unfolds...
